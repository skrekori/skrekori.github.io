					<h1> Home </h1><!-- Home, About us, Contact, etc. -->
				
					<p>   Surfside Diner sits steps from the water in California. You walk in and feel the history. Original tile floors. Polished chrome stools. Warm wood booths worn smooth over decades. We have served locals, surfers, and road trippers since 1954.
			  
					<p>    [surfers going into a diner] </p><!-- This is a placeholder! Change it to the actual description of your image. -->
                    <p>Breakfast starts at 6 a.m. Pancakes stack high. Bacon cooks crisp. Coffee stays hot and strong. Lunch brings fish tacos, lobster rolls, and hand cut fries. Dinner features daily seafood specials based on the morning catch.

                        You can sit at the counter and watch the grill. You can take a booth with your family. You can grab a window seat and see the tide roll in. We keep service quick and friendly. Most guests are in and out in under an hour, unless they choose to linger.</p>

					<h1> About Us </h1><!-- Home, About us, Contact, etc. -->
				
					<p> I grew up near the ocean, and the beach shaped who I am. I spent my mornings in the water and my evenings watching the sunset with my family. Surfside Diner is a reflection of that life. I wanted to build a place where you can walk in with sandy feet, sit down, and feel at home. The ocean inspires our menu, our space, and the pace we keep every day.</p>
			  
					<p>    [picture of food and family] </p><!-- This is a placeholder! Change it to the actual description of your image. -->
				<p>Family guides every decision I make here. I believe meals bring people closer. That is why we cook from scratch, greet you by name, and treat your table like our own. Many of our staff have worked here for years. Some bring their kids in after school. When you eat at Surfside Diner, you are not just a guest. You are part of our community.</p>
